# Bayesian-Inference
Projects developed during my course in USP SME0809

Bayesian inference is a statistical method that allows us to update our beliefs about uncertain events or parameters in the face of new evidence. At its core, it is grounded in Bayes' theorem, which provides a mathematical framework for revising our prior hyphotesis based on observed data

One of the key strengths of Bayesian inference is its flexibility. It allows us to incorporate prior knowledge or expert opinion into our analysis, which can be particularly useful when dealing with limited data or when historical information is available

Bayesian inference has applications in various fields, finance, medicine, machine learning and many more, modeling data to predict, estimate or validate data

During the course, I've deepened my R programming knowledge, learning how to create graphs on R studio and of course, how to do bayesian inference with the help of a computional tool or not. In the reference, you can check some of my work and here i leave some graphs I've made in some classes
